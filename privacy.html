                    <strong>Analytics Data</strong><br />
                    We use Umami.is, a privacy-focused analytics service, to
                    monitor visitor count and demographics. This helps us
                    understand how our website is being used without
                    compromising your privacy.

                    directly to our internal email system. This information is
                    stored securely in accordance with GDPR best practices and
