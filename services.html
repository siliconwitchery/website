            <p>To really push hardware to the limit, we've adopted state of the art signal processing workflows. Using
                <b>model based design</b> techniques, we're able to develop realtime systems in a matter of days rather
                than months. By incorporating graphical math and simulation tools, we can develop extensive algorithms
                for RF, sensor fusion and machine learning on the edge.</p>
            <p>Deployed code can also be configured according to various industry standard for safety and reliability
                such as <b>MISRA</b>. Our team can advise on such standards if required.</p>

            <p>We can also check for hardware vulnerabilities that may exist between devices on the same board. What do
                you send over that I2C line, and what would happen if someone were to exploit it? We can check.</p>

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Silicon Witchery was founded in 2019 by Raj Nakarja, an ex-wireless systems engineer of Silicon Labs Inc.
                After years of experience developing devices for Wearables and IoT, he found many customers were
                struggling to integrate the advanced features of many of today's modern silicon devices into their products. With a unique
                background of both chip and product, he has formed a team of expert designers to help companies big and
                small bring their products to market.</p>
            <p>Today, Silicon Witchery works with customers large and small across the globe, as well as develops it's
                own module based products for accelerating wearable and IoT products to market.</p>
