                <hr>
                <p>Silicon Witchery was founded in 2019 by Raj Nakarja, an ex-wireless systems engineer of Silicon Labs
                    Inc.
                    After years of experience developing devices for Wearables and IoT, he found many customers were
                    struggling to integrate the advanced features of many of today's modern silicon devices into their
                    products. With a unique
                    background of both chip and product, he has formed a team of expert designers to help companies big
                    and
                    small bring their products to market.</p>
                <p>Today, Silicon Witchery works with customers large and small across the globe, as well as develops
                    it's
                    own module based products for accelerating wearable and IoT products to market.</p>

            <h2>IoT Penetration Testing</h2>
            <p>Remote devices can become a dangerous entry point into your secure infrastructure. We check a magnitude
                of security vulnerabilities using the same tools bad actors employ to break into systems.</p>
            <p>We can also check for hardware vulnerabilities that may exist between devices on the same board. What do
                you send over that I2C line, and what would happen if someone were to exploit it? We can check.</p>
