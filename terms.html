                responsibility for that party's information technology infrastructure,
                including computers, servers, software, databases, electronic systems,
                and networks, whether operated directly by such party or through the

            <p>
                <strong>3.4 Disruption by Customer.</strong> You shall not take or

                Platform or any other customer's use of or access to the Platform,
                including by interfering with, intruding into, disrupting, or making
                repeated accesses or requests that cause performance degradation to
                any network, equipment, server, or software system used to host or
                otherwise implement the Platform. If your use of the Platform results
                or may result (in Silicon Witchery's reasonable judgment) in any
                compromise, disruption, or denial of service related to the Platform,
                Silicon Witchery may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform,
                data, and/or traffic from you, in whole or in part.

                <strong>13.1 Confidentiality Agreement.</strong> Each party undertakes
                to keep confidential and not disclose to any third party all

                obtained or received as a result of the discussions leading up to
                or the entering into or performance of this Agreement. "Confidential

                business information disclosed by the disclosing party (whether by
                oral, written, graphic, or machine-readable format), which is
                designated in writing to be confidential or proprietary, or which
                would under the circumstances appear to a reasonable person to be
                confidential or proprietary.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>13.2 Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> The
                receiving party agrees to take at least the same security precautions
                to protect against disclosure or unauthorized use of such Confidential
                Information that the receiving party takes with its own proprietary
                information, but in no event will the receiving party apply less
                than reasonable precautions. Neither party shall use or disclose the
                Confidential Information of the other party except to exercise rights
                or fulfill obligations as expressly permitted under this Agreement
                or by applicable law.

                of the receiving party; (c) is disclosed to the receiving party by
                a third party who may transfer or disclose such information without
                restriction; (d) is disclosed by the receiving party with the
                disclosing party's written approval; or (e) is independently developed
                by the receiving party without any use of Confidential Information
                of the disclosing party.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>13.4 Disclosure Required by Law.</strong> In the event that
                the receiving party is required by law to make any disclosure of
                Confidential Information of the disclosing party, by subpoena, judicial
                or administrative order, or otherwise, the receiving party shall first
                give written notice of such requirement to the disclosing party, and
                shall permit the disclosing party to intervene in any relevant
                proceedings to protect its interests in the Confidential Information.

                all copies of all Confidential Information of the disclosing party
                in its possession or control, except that the receiving party may
                retain a single archive copy to the extent required to comply with
                applicable legal and regulatory requirements, provided that the
                receiving party maintains such Confidential Information in compliance
                with this Agreement until destroyed.
